1. game.py:      tried a basic implementation with python to understand the flow of game.
2. twoPlayer.pl: created a simple replica of the above in prolog (human vs human)         
3. onePlayer:    tried human vs computer with a bit of AI (i think so)
4.               merge any one of the above two with python gui
